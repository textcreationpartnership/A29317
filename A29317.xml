            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN the year 1521 and the year inſuing, there aroſe a certain number of mutinous and ſeditious perſons, who ſecretly made Factions: they chiefly dwelt in the quarters of <hi>Saxony,</hi> which bordered upon the River <hi>Salah;</hi> among whom their chief was <hi>Nicholas Stork.</hi> They dreamed dreams, and ſaid,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nicholas Stork,</hi> and his accomplices, they preached dreams,</note> That they ſpake familiarly with God by Viſions, they preached their dreams for truths and Divine Oracles; and becauſe that there ſhould come a <hi>new world, wherein ſhould dwell righteouſneſs:</hi> Therefore they ought to exterminate all the wicked, with all the Princes and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Magiſtrates,<note place="margin">oppoſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</note> from off the earth (they called all thoſe <hi>unbelievers</hi> which were not of their Sect and Faction.) From out of this School came <hi>Thomas Muntzer,</hi> Dr. <hi>Balthazar Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Melchior Rink, John Hutt, John Deuter, Lodovike Het<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> &amp;c. All theſe boaſted that they familiarly conferred with the Lord. In their teachings, they with heat of affection did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame and detract from the Miniſters of the Goſpel:<note place="margin">and Miniſters.</note> afterward with the like violence fell upon the Magiſtrate, thinking that if they could make void theſe two Orders unto the Church, the wolves might ſafely fall upon and diſmember the Flock; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe wolves, (i. e.) theſe falſe Teachers, have alwayes principally ſet themſelves againſt the Miniſters of the Church, and the Magiſtrates, to ſee if they could drive them out from

the Flock, or at leaſt diſguſt ſome of the ſheep againſt their Paſtors; that ſo eſtranging them from them, they might undo them.</p>

and that without doubt being thus urged, he would declare himſelf by ſome evident ſign, quenching the thirſt of the ſpirit, and doing unto us as formerly unto the Fathers.</hi> He ſaid moreover, That <hi>Gods will was declared by dreams, and there laid the foundations of his doctrine; inſomuch that if the dream of any might be interpreted, he praiſed him greatly in his Sermons.</hi>

Theſe being driven out, they fall upon pillaging their Eſtates: by this every one may know by what ſpirit theſe Anabaptiſtical Hypocrites were led: there is no act ſo fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, horrible, cruel and wicked, that ever was done, which they did not commit. In the beginning they talked of nothing but the Spirit and Holineſs; they ſaid, it was not lawful for a Chriſtian to be a Magiſtrate, and that it was not lawful to bear Arms; but after they had brought all under their paw, and in their power, then it was lawful to take the Publick Arms, with the Town-houſe, and to chuſe a Magiſtrate to their minde, yea, with rejection of him that was ordained of God; and thruſt themſelves into his place, and to make themſelves Conſuls and Senators as they have done: there is not need of much ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the world knoweth it. Where now are the fair ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of thoſe Anabaptiſts? <hi>Do not reſiſt evil: He that will take away thy coat, give him thy cloak alſo.</hi> Theſe have not only pillaged and ſtript honeſt men of their clothes, but of all that they had, and have driven them miſerable out of their houſes, with their wives and little ones, and have expoſed them to death by the Beſiegers of the City.</p>
            <p>At that time there aroſe in the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> a great number of Prophets (for they uſurped that name) the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of whom were <hi>John Matthews</hi> of <hi>Harling,</hi> and one <hi>Piſtor,</hi>

The Law-ſuits which ordinarily came before him, were for the moſt part about Women and Divorces, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſome who had lived almoſt all their life long together, now ſeparated one from another. It came to paſs one day, that when the people were in the Market-place, cloſe crouding, and in a throng to hear, that <hi>Knipperdoling</hi> leaped on their heads, and ſcrambling with his hands and feet being now above them, he breathed upon the men one after another into their mouthes, ſaying, <hi>The Father hath ſanctified thee,</hi>

               <hi>but now the Father hath commanded me to do it before the King:</hi> but becauſe he did it too long, and would not make an end, the King was angry, and went his way. He ſuddenly mounted into the Throne;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94872:13"/>
but the King ſurprizing him, threw him down, and three dayes kept him in Priſon.</p>
            <p>Is there not here to be ſeen a wonderfull rage and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Who could have believed that any bearing humane ſhape, ſhould have been left to commit things ſo fooliſh, abſurd, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous and execrable? but it cannot be otherwiſe with ſuch as violate, trample upon, and reject the Word of God; they are by Divine judgement ſmitten, ſo as to be an example to the Elect. But let us behold their goodly glorious King, now mounted with more then Royal Pomp: where is the ſpirit of theſe Anabaptiſts, who were ſo ready to reprove and reject others? At firſt they cried out againſt all; if they ſaw any Matron wear ſilk, or any man of faſhion to wear a gold Ring, they cried down all: but now their glorious King Taylor omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing, that may ſet forth his Pomp and State. In the beginning they would not bear to hear, that any honeſt man ſhould be a Bailiff, or Governour of a Village; but ſoon the wind is changed, and now by command from the Father, their King is not King of a Village, but of the whole World; for ſo he cauſed himſelf to be ſtyled. During this Siege; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of <hi>Munſter</hi> publiſhed a Book, which they intituled, <hi>The Riſtitution;</hi> wherein they maintained <hi>Muntzers,</hi> damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and an infinite of Errours.</p>
            <p>Afterwards in the Moneth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> on the day which is called S. <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> the new Prophet called <hi>John Twiſcoſcar</hi> ſounded the Trumpet through the ſtreets, and cried out, that <hi>All ſhould meet in Arms about the way to the great Church; for they muſt give a repulſe to the Enemies of the City:</hi> being thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come, they finde a Supper ready, which the King had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; and by command the people did ſit down, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of four thouſand: the King, Queen, and Courtiers wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Table.

of Devils, then the Table of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now when the Supper was ended, the new Prophet gat him up into the Pulpit, and asked them whether they would obey the Word of God? they all ſaid, Yes:<note place="margin">

Then he named them in order, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the place whither each ſhould go: Six were ſent to <hi>Oſemberg,</hi> as many to <hi>Warrendort;</hi> eight to <hi>Suſar,</hi> and as many to <hi>Corsfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King and the Queen with thoſe that ſerved at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſupped afterwards,<note place="margin">The King and Queen and the <hi>28</hi> Teachers ſup together.</note> and thoſe which were appointed to be ſent forth. As they were at Supper, the King roſe up, and ſaid, <hi>That he had received a Commiſſion from the Father:</hi> whereas upon an adventure there was a Souldier which had been taken, the King accuſed him that he was a Traitor as <hi>Judas,</hi> and with his own hands cut off his head. This being done, he returned to ſit down at Table, and by way of merriment recited what he had done. After Supper within night, they cauſed the twenty eight above-mentioned, to depart out o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the City; and over and above their expences, they gave to every one of them certain pieces of Gold, to leave in ſuch places where their Doctrine ſhould not be received, in witneſs of their perdition, and eternal damnation, for their refuſal of the peace and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation.</p>
            <p>And when they were arrived at the places aſſigned unto them, they began to run through the City with horrible cries, crying, <hi>Repent, repent, otherwiſe ye will ſuddenly periſh:</hi> then they caſt their garments upon the ground, and threw their pieces of Gold which were given unto them upon their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, aſſuring them that they were ſent by the Father, to bring peace unto them if they would receive it: they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to put all their goods in common; if they did refuſe it, by this ſign, and as by a mark, they did bear witneſs againſt their ingratitude, and evil deeds: for behold the time now is come, which was foretold by the Prophets, wherein the Lord God would, that Righteouſneſs ſhould reign through
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94872:14"/>
all the earth: and after that the King ſhall have diſcharged his truſt, and ſhall have ſo done, that Righteouſneſs ſhall reign every where; Then Chriſt ſhall deliver up the Kingdome to the Father.</p>
            <p>Upon thoſe words they were apprehended, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning fairly demanded, then by the Rack examined of their faith, life, and Ammunition of the City. They anſwered, that they alone had the true Doctrine, which they would unto the death maintain: for ſince the Apoſtles time the Goſpel was not truly preached, and that there was no righteouſneſs; that there were four Prophets, two of which were true, namely, <hi>David George,</hi> and <hi>John Becold</hi> of <hi>Leyden;</hi> two were falſe, namely, the Pope, and <hi>Luther</hi> worſe then the Pope. Being asked why they drave the honeſt people out of the City, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their faith and promiſe, and detained their Goods, Wives and Children; and by what Text of Scripture they could war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that unrighteouſneſs? They anſwered, That the time was now come, wherein the Word of Chriſt ſhould be fulfilled, <hi>that the meek ſhould poſſeſs the earth;</hi> and that God in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gave the goods of the Egyptians unto the Iſraelites: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they declared their Ammunition and Victuals that was in the City, with their Garriſon, ſome of whom had above five Wives. Moreover, that they looked for Souldiers from <hi>Friſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> who being arrived, the King would take the Field with all his Army, to reduce the whole World under his power and ſubjection, after he had ſlain their Kings which did not righteouſneſs. After they were queſtioned, and ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their opinions, they were all beheaded, except one who eſcaped.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time there aroſe another Prophet, called <hi>Henry Hilvers,</hi> a wicked man, ſubtil and wary; he came to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King and the people, that the heavenly Father had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto him, that three rich Cities with all their goods ſhould be given unto them by God, namely, <hi>Amſterdam, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter,</hi> and <hi>Weſel.</hi> The King hearing this, ſet himſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with his Council, by what means they might bring theſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94872:14"/>
three Cities unto Anabaptiſm; and to this effect they ſent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men unto theſe places. In the firſt place he ſent <hi>James Campenſe</hi> to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and commanded him to be Prince in that City, and ordered him <hi>John Matthews</hi> of <hi>Middleburg</hi> to be his conſort: they Went into <hi>Holland,</hi> and hid themſelves at a Sectaries houſe, and there with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their miſchievous doctrine they impoyſoned many, re-baptized their diſciples, and ſecretly by night held Conventicles and Meetings; yea, alſo they ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their poyſon in the neighbouring Cities: for in the City of <hi>Leyden,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>January,</hi> in the year following, 1535, many were put to death for Anabaptiſm, and for their ſeditious counſels and enterpriſes. Moreover, in the end of the year 1534 the King ſent into <hi>Friſeland, John Gelen,</hi> a ſubtil man, and well vers'd in arms, he having formerly had charge in the Army; the King gave him good ſtore of gold out of the ſpoil of the Churches, and gave him in charge to raiſe an Army in <hi>Friſe;</hi> and acted ſo by certain men that aſſiſted him, that on the 30 of <hi>March</hi> 1535, he muſtered up and raiſed an Army, and took a Monaſtery, and drave out the Friers, and there quartered his Camp, until his Army ſhould augment and be compleated. <hi>George Schenck</hi> who was then Governour of <hi>Friſe,</hi> ſpeedily aſſaulted them as ſeditious perſons: they valliantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves, but he gained the Victory and defeated them; but not without great loſs: they were all cut off ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſixty, who were brought to <hi>Leanard,</hi> and after were pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed according to their deſerts. Their Captain <hi>John Gelen</hi> eſcaped and fled to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to be the author of ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſedition; where he found many Anabaptiſts, whom <hi>James Campenſe</hi> had ſeduced; he promiſed them great matters, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalting the glory and liberty at <hi>Munſter,</hi> magnificently preaching the new raign of righteouſneſs upon earth. For by this time the renown of <hi>Munſter</hi> was ſpread, which anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the courage of many; ſeeing ſo great an Army had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged them, yea, and had ſtormed them often, with the loſs of many; and that they ſaw the Anabaptiſts to perſiſt in their purpoſe: many who were deſirous to be freed from their debts,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94872:15"/>
and to triumph, did greatly deſire to enjoy the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Munſter. Henry Geſbell</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> a ſtout man, and of renown for Souldiery, was gained by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts, and was very familiar with <hi>John Gelen;</hi> who being drawn to their party by large promiſes, much was wrought by him: for in the concluſion 600 Anabaptiſts met together, with whom they intended and attempted to take <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to ſet up their new raign, as they had done at <hi>Munſter:</hi> for upon the 10. of <hi>May,</hi> the firſt and the chiefeſt of them, aſſembled in the houſe of <hi>Peter Gale;</hi> where after conſultation they came forth into the ſtreet; for that day the Citizens were merry, and had according to a cuſtom among them been at a Game.</p>
            <p>About 10 a clock, the Anabaptiſts ran together in the ſtreets, about the Croſs, which was a publick place, crying out, <hi>Amend your lives,</hi> &amp;c. whoſoever will this night be rich and happy, let him march along with us: and as the number of their people encreaſed more and more, they ſlew part of them who had charge of the watch, and the other part they took priſoners. Now the Citizens aſſembled themſelves, and aſſaulted the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts; but they carried the matter ſo ill, as that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul was ſlain, and the reſt put to flight; but then they reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their ſtrength, and gave battel unto the Anabaptiſts, who were then defeated, though with much blood which then was ſhed; among whom <hi>John Gelen,</hi> and <hi>Henry Gesbel</hi> were ſlain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Campenſe</hi> was taken, and executed by the hand of juſtice. Afterwards in many parts of thoſe places of <hi>Holland,</hi> the Anabaptiſts raiſed tumults and ſeditions; not without loſs and great damage unto ſeveral honeſt people, for they could not keep themſelves quiet: for when they were defeated in one part, they began in another; making in ſecret many diſciples, who waited for the reſtoring of the Kingdom unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a certain man in the Town of <hi>Leyden,</hi> who being forced unto it by torments, confeſſed that the King of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts dwelt in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tricht;</hi> but that he was not yet crowned, but only deſigned to be Prince in the Kingdom of Iſrael: this priſoner was not only found poſſeſſed of veſſels of ſilver and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94872:15"/>
gold, which by evil practiſe he had ſtoln; but alſo guilty of ſeveral crimes, for which he was executed: there is no doubt, but that by this King they did intend <hi>David George.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, although at <hi>Munſter</hi> their King and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had made unto the poor people moſt great and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent promiſes; yet now every day they were oppreſſed with great neceſſity, and chiefly through Famine, inſomuch as many were ſtarved, and died for want of bread.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants ſecretly reſolved to apprehend the King, and to deliver him up unto the Biſhop, and by this means to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their peace: the King making doubt hereof, and not truſting to himſelf; he choſe twelve men, whom he judged would be moſt faithful unto him, and appointed them to be Captains of each Quarter of the City, that he might be in the better reſt and aſſurance; afterwards he promiſed the people, that by <hi>Eaſter</hi> they ſhould be freed and delivered from this ſiege, and all their poverty; for he hoped that the Legates which he had ſent into <hi>Friſe</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and other Regions, having raiſed Souldiers, would make ſome ſtirs; and that by this means the ſiege would be raiſed before <hi>Munſter:</hi> but he was deceived by his vain hopes, as we have heard (for there was a goodly diſpatch of his Legates:) He promiſed great matters to the Captains which he had choſen; how when the Camp ſhould be raiſed before the City, he would make them great Lords and Princes; and particularly he gave unto <hi>John Dents</hi> the Empire of <hi>Saxony:</hi> whereby appeared the bruitiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diabolical rage of this pleaſant and goodly King Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, to promiſe to give that which was none of his own; and to take it away from him, to whom God had given it.</p>
            <p>In the Moneth of <hi>February,</hi> the famine was ſo great, that many died through hunger and want. One of the Queens (for there were many) called <hi>Eliſa,</hi> out of pity to the People, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally ſaid, That ſhe did not believe that it was pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that the people ſhould thus periſh through famine: The King, who had ſtore of good proviſion in his houſe, not only for neceſſity, but alſo to make good cheer; withal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94872:16"/>
this, brought her into the Market place with all the other Queens, and commanded them all to fall down upon their knees about her; and unſheathing his ſword he ſtruck off her head from off her ſhoulders: and not being contented herewith, he reproached her as a bawd: the other wives fell a ſinging after this goodly deed, <hi>Glory be unto God in the higheſt;</hi> and gave thanks unto the heavenly Father: and then they fell a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; the King led the Galliard, and exhorted the poor people to leap, dance, and to rejoyce alſo, who had nought left but a little bread and ſalt.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Eaſter</hi> was come, and that there appeared no ſign of deliverance, the people were, and that not without cauſe, much grieved: The King who all along fed them with fair promiſes, fell ſick, and continued ſo ſix dayes together, that he might cover himſelf with ſome excuſe: after thoſe ſix dayes, he came into the Market place, and there ſhewing himſelf, he told the people, that he had promiſed them deliverance: but it muſt ſpiritually be underſtood, and behold this was the deliverance; he ſaid, That he had rode the blinde Aſs, and that the Father had laid upon him the ſins of the multitude; and that he had born them, and taken them away: and that now they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all their ſins; which was the deliverance that he had promiſed unto them. Thus muſt the poor and miſerable people content themſelves, to hear this execrable blaſphemy. The blind Aſs of this Gallant, whereupon this devilliſh and deſperate man rode, was the poor people, that endured and did bear the enormities of ſuch a villain, whom they adored.</p>
            <p>If we ſhould reckon up the miſeries, calamities, and other evils which thoſe of the City endured, it were a miſerable thing to hear: divers who would not bear the famine, fled to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; not ſo much looking for mercy, as that their pain might be expired by death: many crawled upon their bellies in the ſtreets, and others dyed in the wayes: it was an horrible thing to ſee many walking quite ſtripped of fleſh, nothing left but skin upon the bones. Their ears, lips, cheeks, and noſes were ſo ſhrunk up, as one might almoſt ſee day-light through them, as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94872:16"/>
through a piece of Paper. Through feebleneſs, they could not carry their bodies: ſome went to the enemy diſarmed, trailing a ſtaff in their hands: whiles proviſion laſted, none talked of going to the enemy; but now when this was ſpent, then began their deſolation and diſcontent: yet they helpt themſelves as long as they could: They ſowed in the ſides of the walls, and in all waſte places, rapes, peaſe, and ſuch ſeeds, and with this they made ſhift to paſs the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: But when this crop was ſpent, then it was as Veniſon to them to feed on dogs, rats and mice; and when the City was taken, there were but two horſes left alive: many were ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with hunger, as that they did eat the fleſh of dead carcaſſes. Finally, they boiled ſhoes, old leather, and skins, and beat them together, and put them into a pot, and mingled all ſorts of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter together, which they could finde: this was inſtead of bread; and yet this villain and wicked cheater deceived them, telling them, God tried them, to ſee whether they would be faithful and conſtant; and that certainly the Father would deliver them in a ſhort time. Now they that would depart out of the City, to be delivered from theſe miſchiefs, were to preſent themſelves before the King: and there this Robber took from them all that they had; and when they were ranſacked, he ſaid, Now get you gone to the Hereticks.</p>
            <p>The King had yet proviſion of Victuals in his Palace, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Moneths; but it was only for his Courtiers. They conſulted how they might victual the City. Then there ſtood forth one named <hi>Hansken Vander Langke-ſtrate,</hi> he was one of the Kings Secretaries, and one in whom he confided much: he undertook to re-victual the City, and to bring in three hundred Souldiers to their aſſiſtance, and all in fifteen dayes. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the City, and under this pretence went unto the enemy; and for a certain ſum of money ſold the City unto the Biſhop, offering to loſe his life if he did not accompliſh it: the time for this Plot to be put in execution, was the even of S. <hi>Johns</hi> day, at ten a clock in the night; and that he would open the Gate unto them, provided they came without noiſe, to the Gate
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94872:17"/>
of the Croſs. Then this Purveyour returned unto the City, and comforted the King, telling him, That he had well ordered his buſineſs; and that within fifteen dayes they ſhould have a recruit of Victuals and Souldiers. When the day was come, he told the Watch, That this night their aid and victuals ſhould come; and therefore when they ſaw them approach, that they ſhould take heed that they made no noiſe, but be very quiet. At the very time appointed, at ten a clock in the night, the Gate was opened, and the enemy entred. They kill'd the Sentinels, and the <hi>Corps du Gard,</hi> having got the Word. Being thus entred into the City, the Trumpets ſound an Alarm; ſuddenly the King and his men put themſelves into a poſture to fight, and to repulſe the enemy back again to the Gate, which was now ſhut by ſome of the Citizens. The enemies without broke up the Gates; for they heard how they charged upon their people within: and being now entred in, they diſplay their Colours. Thoſe of the City abode the brunt a little at firſt, and were drawn up in the Market place: the Battel was very great. The King, <hi>Knipperdoling</hi> and <hi>Crechting,</hi> were taken: then <hi>Rotman</hi> ſeeing no hope to eſcape, thruſt himſelf into the middle of the enemies, and there was run through, becauſe he feared to be taken alive. But when the Anabaptiſts heard that their King was taken, their courage failed them, and they hid themſelves here and therein Cellars, holes and Shop-bulks, yea, if it had been poſſible, would have ran into mouſe-holes. They were ten dayes in pillaging the City, and they found in the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace proviſion for 200 men for two Moneths: whereas the poor people were for a long time ſtarved. This was called, <hi>To have things in common;</hi> when as ſome had to eat, and others were ſtarved. This was like <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi>'s dealing before the Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> taken, the 25 of <hi>June</hi> 1535. The King was three days after, by a guard of Souldiers brought to a Caſtle three leagues from the City, called <hi>Dulme.</hi> As ſoon as the Biſhop perceived the King, he cried out, Oh thou wretch! how haſt thou brought ſpoil and waſte to me, and to my poor
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94872:17"/>
people! The King readily and proudly anſwered, lifting up himſelf, and deſpiſing the Biſhop, ſaid, <hi>Prieſt, we have not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thee one mite, but we have delivered a ſtrong City into thine hands, which is able to ſtand out againſt all ſtrength: yet if We have done thee damage, if thou wilt hearken unto us, we will make make thee rich.</hi> The Biſhop hearing that, could not forbear laughing, and asked him, how he would do it? The King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, <hi>Get Baskets made of Iron, and cover them over with Leather, and put me in one of them, and cauſe me to be carried through the Country, and let no man ſee me, but he that ſhall give thee a peny; and by this means, thou ſhalt receive more money then thou haſt ſpent in the War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better and moſt holy Anabaptiſts hung about their necks the mark and enſign of their King engraven in Braſs, marked with theſe three letters, <hi>D. W. E.</hi> which in their language ſignified, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh.</hi> The King had for his Title, <hi>I John by the grace of God, and by vertue of the new Kingdome to come in the Temple of God, Miniſter of Righteouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the King with his two Companions were carried Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners here and there unto the Princes, by which means the Miniſters of the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> had opportunity to confer with the King, and to diſpute with him about the principal Points, <hi>viz.</hi> The Kingdome of Chriſt, The Magiſtrate, Baptiſm, The Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Lord, The Lords Supper, Marriage: and by teſtimonies of Scripture unto them, ſo acted, as though in all things they changed not: notwithſtanding all the oppoſitions they made to defend their opinions, yet they yielded ſomewhat; which the King did (as ſome thought) in hope to ſave his life: for at the ſecond time of their return, he promiſed them, if they would grant him his liberty, to ſilence the Anabaptiſts, which were in great numbers in <hi>Holland, Brabant, England,</hi> and <hi>Friſeland,</hi> and to bring them in ſubjection to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>The 20 of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1536. the King and his two Companions were brought back to <hi>Munſter,</hi> and put in ſeveral Priſons; the two next dayes were ſpent in holy Remonſtrances, to reduce
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94872:18"/>
them from their errours. The King acknowledged his ſin, and had recourſe to Chriſt by prayer: the other two acknowledged not their faults, but ſtood out. The next day the King was brought forth upon a Scaffold, and tied to a poſt; where were two executioners with hot burning tongs: he indured the three firſt pinchings of the tongs, without ſpeaking word; afterward he ceaſed not to call upon the mercy of the Lord. Thus for a whole hour and more, was he torn and diſmembred; and to diſpatch him out of the world, he was run through with a ſword: his two Companions had the like end. Their bodies were put into iron Cages, and hung upon S. <hi>Lamberts</hi> Tower, for a perpetual memorial. Let none think we recite ſtories of the Anabaptiſts, which are not to be believed, by adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto of our own; God forbid that we ſhould ſo do: for there are many yet living, who were eye-witneſſes of theſe things, and preſent when they were done. I ſpeak this, that none might be hindred from getting profit by this Hiſtory, which is true and certain, and brought to light for the inſtruction of <hi>the people of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1535. upon the 3 of <hi>February,</hi> in the City of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in the ſtreet of the <hi>Salines,</hi> in the houſe of one <hi>John Silert,</hi> who then was far from home, there aſſembled ſeven men and five women, then called Anabaptiſts, among whom there was one called <hi>Theodore Sarter,</hi> who was there inſpired; he lay ſtretched out flat upon the ground, for ſome ſpace of time, before the other brethren and ſiſters: who in the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened; and prayer being made with great gravity, or rather fair hypocriſie, he then ſaid, That he had ſeen God in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; alſo that he had a viſion of all things in heaven and in hell; and that the great day of Judgement was now come: Afterwards he pulled off all his garments, not leaving ſo much as to cover his ſhameful parts withall. He commanded the reſt of his brethren and ſiſters to follow his example, upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for ſaid he, <hi>The children of God muſt ſtrip themſelves, and put off whatſoever is made, and born of the earth; inaſmuch as truth is naked, and cannot abide to be wrapped up in any thing:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94872:18"/>
therefore, to ſhew themſelves veritable and true, ought to unclothe themſelves.</hi> The poor people hearing this, put off their clothes; and being no wayes aſhamed, became quite naked. <hi>Theodore</hi> commanded them all to imitate him: he leapt out of doors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the publick quite naked, as alſo did the reſt of the men and women, who followed him, crying after an horrible manner, <hi>Wo, wo, wo, Divine vengeance, Divine vengeance, &amp;c.</hi> and in this manner they ran furiouſly through the City, like mad peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, crying out ſo hideouſly as never was known.</p>
            <p>Then the Citizens ran to take arms (for they knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the City were ſurprized by enemies, or what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of this ſtir.) Finally, theſe impudent people were taken being quite naked; and being queſtioned upon the 5 of <hi>March,</hi> theſe ſeven men were beaten and ſcourged: the firſt of them cried out, <hi>Praiſe the Lord for evermore:</hi> another ſaid, <hi>Lord, avenge the blood of thine:</hi> the third, <hi>Open your eyes, &amp;c.</hi> the fourth ſaid, <hi>Wo, wo.</hi> Afterwards the women were brought to puniſhment: when they were taken, they offered them gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but they rejected them, ſaying, <hi>That the truth ought to be naked.</hi> What men ever heard of ſuch impudency or fury? In the ancient ſtories we reade of <hi>Adamites,</hi> who alſo went na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; but it was only among themſelves, and at their Feſtival dayes: but theſe far ſurpaſs them.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Adam</hi> ſaw himſelf naked, he ſought for covering; and finding nothing more fit then leaves, he made uſe of thoſe of a Figtree: but theſe, when as garments were tendred unto them, they refuſed them; and like dogs ran without ſhame. Behold what befalleth thoſe that leave the word of God, to cleave unto dreams and Satanical illuſions! but behold their madneſs, in that they dare attribute ſo much villany unto the holy Spirit of God, and to make him the author of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs: they ought to have in remembrance, with what gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth women to have their heads covered in the Church: what would he have ſaid if he had ſeen or known women to run without ſhame quite naked like Bitches, who commanded that women apparel themſelves in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94872:19"/>
habit, with ſhamefac'dneſs and modeſty?</p>
            <p>The things which were done by theſe Anabaptiſts in the Towns of St. <hi>Gall</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> are not leſs hideous nor hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible then theſe, whereof we have already heard. For in the year 1526, two brethren which came out of the ſame womb, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Leonard Schitker,</hi> inhabiting neer unto the town called <hi>Mulleg;</hi> the 7. of <hi>February,</hi> by night there aſſembled a great number of Anabaptiſts in their Fathers houſe, who ſpent all the night in preaching and doing marvelous deeds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of viſions: at Sun-riſing, upon the 8 of <hi>February, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> took his brother <hi>Leonard,</hi> and ſet him in the midſt of his kindred, and of all the company, commanding him to fall down upon his knees: now as the reſt admoniſhed him, to do no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming thing unto his Brother, he anſwered them, That they needed not to fear, for he ſhould do nothing there, but the will of the Father: in the mean while unſheathing a Sword he cut off his brothers head, who was upon his knees before them all. As all the company were ſmitten with great fear, and made great and lamentable complaints, <hi>Thomas</hi> who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this Murther, ſuddenly flyeth out of the Town, uſing horrible behaviours, as the cuſtom of the Anabaptiſts is to do.</p>
            <p>This Enthuſiaſt at that time came before the Conſul in the town of St. <hi>Gall.</hi> Mr. <hi>Joachim Vadian,</hi> an excellent man and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for piety and learning, being preſent, this Anabaptiſt cryed out fearfully before him, <hi>The day of the Lord is at hand, the day of the Lord cometh:</hi> he added further, that at the break of day, there had been ſome great thing done, (but that he concealed the matter) and that the will of the Father was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and that it had been ſteeped in Gall and Vinegar: the Conſul reproved him, and chid him ſharply, becauſe of his fury and immoderate cryes, commanding him to cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to return to his houſe, and to behave himſelf peaceably. Suddenly his villanous murther was divulged, and he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and diligently examined by torture; and afterwards <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> his villanous fact, by the hand of the Magiſtrate executed and put to death. This poor Anabaptiſt had forgot the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94872:19"/>
of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12, &amp;c. but God by his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgement and providence, ſuffered ſuch villanous and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable deeds to be committed by theſe perſons, that theſe wayes may be abominated.</p>

            <p>That befalleth theſe perſons, which is common to ſuch as once ſtray, and turn aſide from the right path, and the good old way: by how much further they are off and diſtant from the right path, and the more progreſs they make; ſo much the farther do they wander from the right way: after that they had built the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> God ſo confounded their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that they underſtood not one another; and they are divided among themſelves, yea, they have damned and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated one another, and made divers Churches apart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out familiarity or communion together.

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:94872:20"/>Let us now come to behold ſome of their ſtrange opinions; for that were a work never to be done, to deſcribe them all. We ſhall begin with <hi>Thomas Muntzer,</hi> of whom mention was made in the beginning of the Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Firſtly, He wrote and taught publickly, that the Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpel, were not ſent of God: and that they preached not the true word of God, but were Scribes and Phariſees, preaching only the dead Letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he ſaid, That the writing of the Old Teſtament, and the preaching of the eternal word, was not the word of God, but was only the teſtimony thereof: and that we muſt ſearch for the word in the internal part, <hi>i. e.</hi> in our hearts, where God hath put it, that we need not go far to ſeek it from without us: The Scribe-Miniſters (ſaith he) think that faith cometh by the Scriptures and preaching, but they are very far off: for all the Scriptures lead us hither, that we muſt be taught and learned of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Jer</hi> 31.34.</p>

               </label> It was very needful for theſe Anabaptiſts, to begin here to ſet up their Sect and Faction: they muſt ſay and plainly affirm, that the Miniſters are not ſent of God, that they might the more withdraw the poor people from them. The Reaſons which move them ſo to ſpeak, as they pretend, are <hi>Pauls</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Be an Example,</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Apoſtle ſheweth it is needful for the Miniſter to approve his calling by purity of life,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2.</note> otherwiſe it will be vain and falſe; alſo the Biſhop muſt be unblameable. Our new Mennoniſts and Franniques are of the ſame opinion. But in the mean while, who ſeeth not that they endeavour above all things, to ſet up their own works and righteouſneſſes, and Phariſee-like to judge &amp; condemn all ſuch as do not as many works as they? It is many times ſo, that Harlots will boaſt themſelves more of their chaſtity then honeſt Matrons: ſo it was with the falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles at <hi>Corinth,</hi> that they might bring the true Apoſtles of Chriſt into diſrepute; they ſo boaſted of their own vertue and lowlineſs, as if the true Apoſtles were in no wiſe to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94872:20"/>
with them. But the Apoſtle is in no wiſe aſtoniſhed at their vain and fooliſh braggings; yea, he plainly derided them, ſaying, <hi>We dare not make ours of the number, nor compare our ſelves with ſome who commend themſelves: but they meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing themſelves with themſelves, are not wiſe:</hi> as if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, they ſo pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in themſelves, that they think and eſteem, that there are none in the World equal or to be compared with themſelves: they conſider not the gifts wherewith others are endued, but their ſight is ſo fixed upon themſelves and their own fair deeds, as that they are perſwaded, that they are the only ones, and the None-ſuch in the world. In the mean while, the Apoſtle lively upbraideth them, ſaying, Such falſe Apoſtles are deceitful work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, diſguiſing themſelves into Apoſtles of Chriſt; and no marvel, ſaith he, for Satan transformeth himſelf into an Angel of light; it is no great matter then, if his Miniſters trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves into the Miniſters of righteouſneſs: whoſe end ſhall be according to their works. Moreover, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not well, that Doctrine far ſurpaſſeth works? ſo as if the Doctrine be not ſound, pure, and true; the works, how holy and fair ſoever they may be, will never prove the calling of a falſe Prophet, that he is ſent from God.</p>
            <p>If it were lawful for us to boaſt, it ſhould not be in our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, perfection, and mortification, as they do; but onely in the pure mercy of God through Jeſus Chriſt: if ſo be that gravity and honeſty of life, were the true ſign of the vocation to the Miniſtry, it would follow, that all honeſt and good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be Miniſters of the Church; but that is well known to be falſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. nor can it be; for there is a command for <hi>every one to walk in the calling wherein he is called,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.29. He asketh alſo, <hi>Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> Every Chriſtian may or ought to reade, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Scripture; it followeth not therefore that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are Preachers and Miniſters of the Churches, but onely thoſe which are lawfully called; nor doth the calling ceaſe for any failing that may be found in the life of the Called (which is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94872:21"/>
not ſpoken to give occaſion to make Miniſters negligent; (God forbid:) but the exhortation of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> is alwayes neceſſary to the Miniſters) no more then <hi>Peter</hi> ceaſed to be a true and lawful Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 6 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</note> when he ſo groſly failed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11, 12. It is well known our Miniſters are called to Office by the voice and common conſent of all the Church; and that after faſting and calling upon the Name of God, according to Apoſtolical inſtitution, and are confirmed in their Office by impoſition of hands: what reaſon is there for theſe Sectaries to ſay, That their Miniſters are called of God, but ours onely by the world and men? if their Miniſters have a ſpecial calling as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had, let them prove it by ſigns, miracles, gifts of tongues, and Apoſtolical Doctrine, as they did: The Church hath no need of your Miniſters; for the Doctrine of Repentance, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life, and of Remiſſion of ſins in the Name of Chriſt, is abundantly declared in the Church of Chriſt: to teach the ſame thing is ſuperfluous; if you teach any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, then you and your Doctrine is accurſed, and not to be heard.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no other thing, then what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> before ſpake to the like glorious Miniſters as theirs be, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. If their ſpirit be ſo full of knowledge and light, ſo as they cannot contain themſelves from preaching without calling; why do they not preach where the Goſpel was never yet declared? they inſinuate themſelves into ſuch places, where the Goſpel hath been preached to the people, with great labour and hazard of life unto the poor Miniſters. It is a marvel, how they will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to enjoy, and partake of the labours of thoſe Miniſters, whom they ſo much hate: they ſecretly by fraud and deceit ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and diſturb in ſuch places the poor ſheep of Jeſus Chriſt, which ought not to be withdrawn from their true Paſtors. I pray all the Flock of Chriſt, not to give heed to ſuch ſtrangers, but rather hearken to the voice of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sectaries do defame and reproach the Miniſters, and ſpeak all evil of them; but it is becauſe they touch them at the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94872:21"/>
quick; becauſe they cry out upon theſe Wolves, and pluck the ſheep-skins from off their backs, that none might be ſurprized by their fair appearance. Seeing the Goſpel-Miniſters are ſtyled <hi>Salt of the earth,</hi> none muſt think ſtrange that the Salt biteth and pricketh, and maketh it ſelf to be Salt: the Salt biteth not where there is no wound, but it is felt where there is a raw place. It will appear then, that they have loſt their ſpiritual ſenſes, who ſay, That <hi>our Miniſters are not called of God:</hi> God hath put ſingular honour upon the Miniſters; yea, what greater could he put upon them, then by ſaying, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me?</hi> the Lord not only by words, hath recommended the Miniſters unto the Church, but alſo by example, hath ſhewn what honour and reverence all ought to have them in. The holy Ghoſt could have taught the Ethiopian Eunuch without the Miniſtry of man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</note> but he would maintain this order.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Cornelius,</hi> God could have taught him by the Angel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 10.5.</note> but he is bid to ſend for <hi>Peter.</hi> When our Lord called <hi>Paul,</hi> he could have inſtructed him himſelf, yet he is ſent to a mortal man, to receive the Doctrine of Salvation, and Baptiſm: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a caſe which fell not out by raſhneſs, that an Angel of God ſhould withdraw from entring upon the Miniſtry,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6</note> and ſhould ſend him to a man, a Miniſter, to preach unto him. Who with a good Conſcience dare then deſpiſe the true Miniſtry, ſo highly honoured of God; and to diſguſt men from the ſame, and to cauſe men to run after thoſe which were not lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but thieves, robbers, and grievous Wolves, which ſpare not the flock of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Let us now come to the ſecond Point: <hi>Muntzer,</hi> after he had ſpued out his poiſon againſt the poor Miniſters of Chriſt, he falls upon the word of the eternal God; and there, that he may leave nothing intire, with open throat he ſpits out his blaſphemies. It is no marvel if he fall upon the Miniſters of the Word, to ſpeak evil of them, ſeeing he dareth ſo outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſet himſelf againſt the very mouth of God: Behold his own words.</p>

As for that which they tax the Miniſters, to be Miniſters of the dead letter, one may plainly ſee the Lords taking vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the outrage offered unto his holy Word; ſmiting them with a ſpirit of giddineſs, for having deſpiſed the true and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means of coming unto God, which is the Scripture and the Word of God.

It is very evident that <hi>Paul</hi> in this place, had to do with falſe Apoſtles, who preached and extolled the Law without Chriſt, and cauſed the people to recoil from Salvation purchaſed by Chriſt, and the grace of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereunto the Lord had promiſed to write his Law in the heart of the faithful:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 24 27.</note> as we may ſee in reading the ſame Chapter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. It is then wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly and wickedly done, to caſt off the Scripture upon ſuch pretence of the Spirit, ſeeing our Lord giveth us his Spirit to underſtand his word: as we ſee Chriſt opened the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the two Diſciples, not by making them wiſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſetting them to look for a new kinde of word, or natural and innate in them, in rejecting the Scriptures; but that they might underſtand the Scriptures. After this manner the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the Theſſalonians not to quench the Spirit: he would not have them fly in the air, after vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94872:24"/>
ſpeculations, without the word of God, but conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he addeth, <hi>deſpiſe not prophecie:</hi> thereby ſhewing, that then the ſpirit is quenched, and ſuffocated, when Prophecie is rejected;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 105.</note> what will thoſe poor Soules anſwer, who have rejected the lanthorn, which God hath given to be a light unto their feet? We confeſs that the external word preached by men, of it ſelf, nor alone, cannot convert the heart, but the Spirit of God muſt work internally, to beget faith in us: now this is done in good order by the preaching of the Goſpel, as appears by <hi>Lydia</hi> the Purple-ſeller, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. ſhe heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach, but the Lord opened her heart, to underſtand the things which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake: for this cauſe the preaching of the Word is called ſeed; we know that if ſeed fall upon a ſpot of ground which is deſert, and not tilled, it is loſt, without producing fruit: but on the contrary,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.15.</note> falling upon ſoil tilled and well manured, it brings forth fruit in abundance. So the word of God, if it fall upon the hard and rebellious brain, it remaineth without fruit, as upon ſtony ſoil: but upon a heart prepared by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt, then it brings forth much fruit; and as the Husband-man when he hath ſown his feed, he can do no more, he cannot make his grain to grow, but leaveth it to God: ſo muſt the Miniſters do; when they have preached and ſown the Word of God, they cannot make it grow, they muſt commend it unto God: as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that planteth is nothing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cor</hi> 3.7.</note>

It appeareth that the Miniſters are joyned in the work with God; inaſmuch as God maketh uſe of them as inſtruments, and he worketh by his word, by giving vertue in the internal man: one may ſee as plainly as day-light, the errour of <hi>Muntzer,</hi> the firſt father of theſe Anabaptiſts, and that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his ſpeech.</p>
            <p>Our Mennoniſts have condemned their Father in this point,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94872:24"/>
notwithſtanding there be others who maintain this opinion, or rather blaſphemy, as ſome ſtrange ſpirits, the diſciples of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian Franque,</hi> who this day do renew the queſtion: yea, ſome little ſpace of time ſince, one of the chief of that Sect, whoſe name I ſhall forbear to declare, in the City of <hi>Frankfort,</hi> before ſeveral honeſt people told me, and with might and main maintained, with divers of his diſciples, That the earth never bare a more abominable Idol, then that which is called the <hi>Bible;</hi> and that all the World doted upon it, looking therein for the word of God, whereas we ſhould look for it in our hearts: and one of them redoubled it, and ſaid in the preſence of Mr. <hi>Aloſco</hi> and of us all, What do you talk ſo much of the Scripture! I aſſure you on my part, I have learned more by ſeeing a Hen or a Capon killed, then ever I learned by all the Sermons and Lectures of the Books that ever I read. Unto whom I anſwered, It muſt needs be that you eat often of Hens and Capons, ſeeing you have learned ſo much by their death: but I pray you, ſaid I, What good did you ever learn thereby? he anſwered, That he had learned to know, the obedience which Jeſus Chriſt rendred unto God his Father upon the Croſs: and that as the fowl was ſlain without making reſiſtance, and that for the good and life of man; ſo was Jeſus Chriſt ſlain for the life of mankinde: it was ſaid then unto him, How do you know that ever there was ſuch an one as Jeſus Chriſt, and that he died for man? do you finde that written in the Capons belly? the Turks alſo do kill Capons, but they cannot reade there, that Chriſt was their Saviour. In the end they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry, and like people deprived of their ſences, when they were hampered by the word of God, and by their own reaſons. What man is there that would not wonder at ſuch fooliſh and irrational diſcourſe? is it not juſt that ſuch people ſhould be ſo handled, ſeeing they have rejected the word of the living God, which the Angels themſelves deſire to pry into, that they ſhould be ſent to School unto the bruit beaſts.</p>
            <p>Further, I come to the Propoſition of <hi>Muntzer,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That the Miniſters are much deceived, thinking that Faith cometh
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94872:25"/>
by hearing, and that it is written, Brother ſhall not teach Brother any more, ſaying, Know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt of them, being all taught of God.</hi>

that the Prophet never intended to bereave their Church of an ornament ſo preaious and neceſſary: The Prophet onely would tell us, that God would manifeſt himſelf to ſmall and great, and that the Church ſhould have children inſtructed and taught of God, as was promiſed by <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> This paſſage then, is very clear behold, the Prophet ſaith, <hi>They ſhall no more teach every man his neighbour, ſaying, Know the Lord;</hi> and why? becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts:</hi> he doth not reject the external Miniſtry of the Word, but he ſheweth, that the knowledge of God cometh not properly by the labour and travel of men, but it is becauſe the Lord engraveth the Law of his Word in the underſtanding: Miniſters by their preaching ſtrike upon mens ears; and God by engraving his Law, worketh upon and teacheth their hearts, as he dealt with <hi>Lydia</hi> at <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching.<note place="margin">

See how theſe poor people are become ſhameleſs, in laying open their filthineſs before all the world! who would not wonder to ſee ſuch ſpiritual people as theſe pretend themſelves to be, to live upon the goods and riches of whore-mongers! this is the honour that they put upon their Fathers and Mothers, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat and brought them forth, yea, and upon themſelves.</p>

They regard the naked letter of the Scripture, They walked as Vagabonds through the Country, and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without ſhoes, without ſtaff, without girdle, and without money: they ſaid, that they were ſent by God; and becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that will enter into the Kingdom of heaven, muſt become as a little child,</hi> they ſaid, We muſt play the children with Children, and therefore they ſo did: and becauſe our Lord ſaith, He that leaveth not all that he poſſeſſeth, whether Wife, Children, Father, Mother, Lands and Inheritance, &amp;c. they often took ſlender occaſions, and left their Country, leaving their wives and children, and went as ſpiritual Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneths: they ſaid, that a Chriſtian ought not poſſeſs any thing as his own, and that it was impoſſible for any to be both rich and a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Who would not wonder to ſee the fooliſhneſs of theſe poor people! they would carry neither ſhoes, ſtaff, nor money in their purſes, like begging Friers: they conſider not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Scripture. The uſe and practiſe of the Apoſtles declare fully, that our Lord ſaid that, to prevent his diſciples from being ſolicitous for things needful for their journey, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould not want, becauſe the labourer is worthy of his hire: this Chriſt inſtructed them in, when he ſaid, <hi>When I ſent you without purſe, without ſcrip, without ſhoes, lacked you any thing?</hi>

but that what he had told them in ſecret, they ſhould preach openly. And as for waſhing of their feet, he would ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe thereby, but that out of love we ſhould be helpful one unto another: for then they had other kind of ſhoes then we have now, ſo as their feet were ſoiled with travelling, and therefore they rightly waſhed their feet, which now we have no uſe of, being ſhod after another manner. Our Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts who practiſe this, I would have them to conſider, how comely this is: for it may fall out through want of women, that men muſt waſh their feet; which how ſeemly it would be, let them judge. When Chriſt ſaith, we muſt be as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it is not ſaid, We muſt be Children, and become fooliſh; but that we ſhould imitate the plainneſs and integrity which is in little children; and that is it which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> holds forth, when he ſaith, <hi>Be not children in underſtanding, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, &amp;c.</hi> in underſtanding be men: and every where in the Scriptures, their wandrings and vagations are condemned; for he ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever taketh not care of his own,</hi>

Whereas the Apoſtle underſtandeth no other thing, then that we ſhould not imitate the world in that which is evil; which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world:</hi> for all that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth this, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17. when he chargeth us that we ſhould <hi>not walk as the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their underſtandings.</hi> It is folly in them to draw theſe words from the true ſenſe, to make them condemn a multitude of things indifferent; as ſome of them will not put on a clean ſhirt upon <hi>Sunday,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unbelievers do ſo: ſome will not call <hi>Munday</hi> or <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> but the firſt and ſecond day of the week; binding their

Conſciences unto ſuch things: they make themſelves ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, becauſe they condemn garments and trimmings, which are not according to their Cut and Rule, by their Taylors, and according to their patern and faſhion. We would not here let looſe the reins to pomp and vanity, but we ſay, We are not to condemn him, who is clothed according to his Eſtate, and according to the cuſtom of the Country; yong people &amp; all according to the received cuſtom, Gentlemen according to their ranks, Merchants, and conſequently all men of Eſtate accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their qualities.

and yet theſe men would baniſh all mirth and laughter.

In the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Iſrael held a Feaſt for fourteen dayes together, becauſe of all the goodneſs of God vouchſafed to <hi>David</hi> his father.

               <p>Some account Childrens Baptiſm ſo bad, as that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be diſmembred, and ſuffer, then to let their Children be baptized. Others ſuffer it as an Ordinance, which neither hindreth nor profiteth. Some account themſelves holy and pure; theſe are ſeparated from others, and have all things in common; none ſaith among them, <hi>This is mine:</hi> and to have any thing in propriety, is accounted a ſin.

               <p>Some ſay they are come ſo high, as that they cannot ſin any more. The moſt pure of them preach up the Croſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution ſo high, that they ſeem to make it an Idol, and a new Saviour, putting of it in the place of Chriſt, for ſalvation, as the Papiſts do their works.

Some are rapt into an extaſie, and have their viſage and countenance changed, lying upon the ground certain hours. Some Tremble and Quake for two or three hours together: after that, when they are come unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they prophecie and ſpeak ſtrange things, as if they had been in another world, or as if they had fallen from out of heaven:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> and they account to have that in common with the Apoſtle, when he was taken up into the third heaven.</p>

In ſome places they baniſh and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all thoſe, which will heare any Preacher or Miniſter preach: they ſpeak all the evil of them that may be, calling them Scribes and Phariſees. Others endure that one may hear, ſee, and read any thing: but in the mean while the manner of Miniſters living pleaſeth them not. They have the Croſs in ſuch eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that they deſpiſe and reject all thoſe which are without it, and perſecution, and ſay, That their caſe is not good: for (ſay they) if they were in the Lords way, they would ſuffer perſecution: ſome therefore ſeek the Croſs, others are of another opinion. And many times they break fair houſholds by ſeparating the parties, when one of the parties is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, the party which is not excommunicated muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the other party; and their excommunications are for very ſmall matters; yea, when they are married one to another, they make them promiſe, that if one of them come to be caſt out of the Church, that the innocent party ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the nocent; and by this means their marriages are all conditional: when one is thus ſeparated, the party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cannot be remarried, if the other party being married be not delivered by the death of his adjoynt: yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it falls out, that ſome who have been excommunicated, are received in again, and finde their party married to another;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94872:32"/>
and there they muſt ſee their wives before their eyes to be unto another man, and they themſelves cannot remarry; yea though they have not the gift of continence, they ſay unto them, as unto the Friers, that they muſt make themſelves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of heaven. Behold how the Devil makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſport with theſe men!

               <p>They ſay alſo, That when a man hath ſinned, though he doth repent, that he is to be excommunicated: and then if he doth perſevere therein, he ſhall be received in again. Behold, the fair ſtir of Satan, how he playeth the game with theſe men, which follow not the true light of the Goſpel. Our Lord be pleaſed to give eyes to all the World, that they may take heed of theſe Sects, which make men turn aſide from the way of truth. So be it.</p>
